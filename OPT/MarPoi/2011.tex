\ques{3}{b}{20} A supermarket has 2 girls ringing up the sales counters. If the service time for each customer is exponential mean 4 minutes and if people arrive in a Poisson fashion at the rate of 10 per hour
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt, itemsep = -1ex,label=(\roman*)]
    \item what is the probability of having to wait for service;
    \item what is the expected percentage of idle time for each girl?
\end{enumerate}
