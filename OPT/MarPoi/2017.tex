\ques{1}{d}{10} Define a transition probability matrix of a Markov chain and state some of its properties. For a Markov chain with three states 0,1 and 2, the transition probability matrix is given by
\[
     \bordermatrix{
      & 0   & 1   & 2   \cr
    0 & 0.4 & 0.3 & 0.3 \cr
    1 & 0.4 & 0.4 & 0.2 \cr
    2 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.4 \cr
    }  \] Obtain $p_{00}^{(2)}$ and $p_{12}^{(3)}$.

\ques{2}{b}{15} State how the queueing model is completely specified. In this context explain the meaninngs of different symbols in the queueing model(M/M/C):($\infty$/FIFO). Obtain the steady-state equations under the model (M/M/I):($\infty$/FIFO) and find their solutions.

\ques{4}{b}{15} Define $n-$step transition probability in a markov chain. Prove the following Chapman-Kolmogorov equation:
\[p_{ij}^{(n+1)} = \sum_k p_{ik}^{(n)}p_{kj} = \sum_k p_{ik}p_{kj}^{(n)}\]
