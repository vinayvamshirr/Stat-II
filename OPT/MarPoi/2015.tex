\ques{1}{d}{10} For a (M/M/1):($\infty|$FCFS) queue system, compute--
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep = -1ex,label=(\roman*)]
    \vspace{-1ex}
    \item expected number of customers in the system;
    \item expected queue length;
    \item excepted (average) waiting time of a customer in the system.
\end{enumerate}
\ques{3}{c}{20} Consider a single-server queue system with Poisson input and exponential service time. Suppose the mean arrival rate is 3 calling units per hour, the expected service time is 0.25 hour and the maximum permissible number of calling units in the system is two. Derive the steady-state probability distribution of the number of calling units in the system and also calculate the expected number in the system.
