\ques{1}{a}{12} If $i$ is a recurrent state with period $t$ with given mean recurrence time $\mu_{ii}$, then show that \[\lim_{n\to\infty} p_{ii}^{nt} = \frac{t}{\mu_{ii}}\]

\ques{1}{b}{12} In (M/M/1):($\infty$/FCFS) queuing model, obtain the expression for the probability that there are $n$ units in the system at any time.

\ques{2}{d}{20} Suppose there is a product of brands A and B respectively. Let each of these two brands have exactly 50 percent of the total market in the same period and let the market be of a fixed size.
The transition matrix is given below:\\
\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
	\begin{game}{2}{2}[From][To]
   	    &  $A$    &  $B$ \\
   	 $A$ &  $.9$ & $.1$ \\
   	 $B$ &  $.5 $ & $.5$ \\
\end{game}
\end{table}
If the initial market share breakdown is 50\% for each brand, then determine their market share in the steady-state.

\ques{3}{b}{25} A repairman is to be hired to repair machines that breakdown following a Poisson process with an average rate of four per hour. The cost of non-productive machine is Rs. 90 per hour. The company has the option of choosing either a fast repairman who charges Rs.60 per hour and repairs machines at the rate of 7 per hour or a slow repairman who charges Rs. 30 per hour and repairs machines at the rate of 5 per hour. Taking the cost in to the consideration find which repairman should be hired.
