\ques{2}{c}{15} Arrivals at a telephone booth are considered to be according to a Poisson process with an average time of 10 minute between two consecutive arrivals. The length of a phone call is assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean of 3 minutes. What is the probability that a person coming to the booth will have to wait? What is the average length of the queues that form from time to time?

\ques{4}{b}{30} Consider a Markov chain with three states 0, 1 and 2. The state 0 is an absorbing state, while from any of the other two states the chain moves into any of the three states with equal probability ,i.e.
\[ P(a/b) \:= \frac{1}{3} \enskip \text{for } a=\:0,1,2 \enskip \text{and } b= \:1,2). 
\]
Starting from either state 1 or 2, let N = the number of steps or transitions needed before absorption into state 0 takes place. Derive the probability distribution of N. What is the expected number of transitions before absorption into state 0?
