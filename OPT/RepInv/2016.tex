\ques{4}{a}{20} What do you mean by probabilistic inventory problems? Discuss the continuous case of a probability inventory model with instantaneous demand and no set-up cost. \\
Let the probability density demand of acertain item during a day be
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0.1, \quad & 0\leq x \leq 10 \\
                        0, \quad & x>10 \end{cases} \]
The demand is assumed to occur with a uniform pattern during the whole day. Let the unit carrying cost of the item in inventory be \rupee 0.5 per day and the unit shortage cost be \rupee 4.5 per day. If \rupee 0.5 be the purchasing cost per unit, determine the optimum order level of the inventory.
