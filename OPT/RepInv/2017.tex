\ques{4}{c}{15} Discuss the single-period continuous probabilistic inventory model with instantaneous demand, shortages and continuous replenishment.\\The probability deistribution of demand D is given by
\[f(D) =  \begin{cases}
0.02 - 0.0002D \quad&, 0\leq D \leq 100, \\
0 &,D>100.
\end{cases} \] The holding cost is Rs 0.50 per day and the shortage cost is Rs 3.20 per day. Determine the optimum order level of the inventory.
