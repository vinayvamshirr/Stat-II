\ques{3}{a}{15} What is replacement problem? How would you determine the replacement policy of items whose maintenance cost increases with time and money carries a rate of interest of r per year?\\ An auto owner finds from his past record that the cost per year of an auto whose purchase cost is Rs. 60,000 is as given below:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{*{3}{c}}\hline
    Year & Running Cost (Rs.) & Resale Value(Rs.) \\ \hline
    1 & 10000 & 30000 \\ 
    2 & 12000 & 15000 \\
    3 & 14000 & 7500 \\
    4 & 18000 & 3750 \\
    5 & 23000 & 2000 \\
    6 & 28000 & 2000 \\
    7 & 34000 & 2000 \\
    8 & 40000 & 2000 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center} Determine at what time is its replacement due.

\ques{3}{c}{20} Derive an expression for finding optimum inventory model in  a single period probabilistic model without set-up cost with continuous demand and discrete replenishment unit.
A baking firm makes a profit of Rs 5.00 per kg of cakes sold on same day it baked and disposes all unsold cakes at a loss of Rs 1.20 per kg. The demand follows rectangular distribution between 2000 and 3000. Find optimum quantity to be baked daily.
