\ques{1}{e}{12} Show that in a linear programming problem the feasible solutions form a convex set.

\ques{2}{a}{30} A person needs at least $10$, $12$ and $12$ units of chemicals $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively for his garden. A liquid product is available in the market contains $5$, $2$ and $1$ units of $A$, $B$ and $C$ respectively per jar. A dry product contains $1$, $2$ and $4$ units of $A$, $B$ and $C$ per carton. The price of liquid product is \rupee  per jar and that of the dry product is \rupee 2 per carton. How many jars and cartons should be purchased to meet the requirements and to minimize the cost.

\ques{2}{b}{15} Consider a zero-sum game between two persons A and B where each player has three strategies $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$ and $B_1$, $B_2$ and $B_3$. Player A's payoff matrix is given below 
\begin{table}[!htbp]
\centering
	\begin{game}{3}{3}[Player A][Player B]
   	    &  $B_1$    &  $B_2$  & $B_3$   \\
   	 $A_1$ &  $15$ & $2$ & $3$ \\
   	 $A_2$ &  $6 $ & $5$ & $7$\\
	 $A_3$ &  $-7$ & $4$ & $0$\\
\end{game}
\end{table}

Is there a saddle point? What are the optimal strategies for the two players?
