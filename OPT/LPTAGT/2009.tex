\ques{1}{b}{12} What are the goals achieved through sensitivity analysis? If in the following linear programming problem (L.P.P) :
\begin{gather*}
    \text{Maximize} \quad z = \:3x_1 + 2x_2 + 5x_3 \\
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Subject to} \quad & x_1 + 2x_2 + x_3 &\leq 430 \\
         3&x_1 + 2x_3 & \leq 460 \\
        & x_1 + 4x_2 &\leq 420 \\
        &x_1,x_2, x_3 \geq 0
    \end{aligned}
\end{gather*}
the profit coefficient of $x_1$ is reduced to 2 from 3, determine whether the original solution remains optimal.

\ques{1}{f}{12} Explain (i) feasible solution and (ii) basic solution in the context of linear programming problem (L.P.P).\\
Prove that the objective function of a L.P.P. assumes its minimum at an extreme point of a convex set generated by the set of all feasible solutions to the problem, and if it assumes its minimum at more than one extreme point then it takes on the same value for every convex combination of those particular points.
