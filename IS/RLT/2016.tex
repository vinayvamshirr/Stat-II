\ques{1}{b}{10} Differentiate between censored and truncated experiment in the context of life testing problems.

\ques{2}{b}{15} Suppose that K components are connected in parallel. Then n such parallel connections are hooked up in aseries into a single system. If each component has the same reliability, say R, for a certain period of operation, assuming independent components, find the expression for the reliability of the entire system.

\ques{4}{b}{15} DEscribe the problem of estimation of the parameter for the exponential density $f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t};\lambda >0,t\geq0$ based on type-I and type-II censored data.
