\ques{2}{b}{20} At a time zero, all items in a system are new. Each item has a probability $p$ of failing immediately before the end of the first month of life, and a probability $q=1-p$ of failing immediately before the end of the second month (i.e., all items fail by the end of the second month). If all items are replaced as they fail, then show that the expected number of failures $f(x)$ at the end on month $x$ is given by
\[f(x) = \frac{N}{1+q}\left[-(-q)^{x+1}\right]\]
where $N$ is the number of items in the system.
