\ques{1}{b}{10} Define (i) Type I censoring, (ii) Type II censoring and (iii) Random censoring. Describe the situations in which they may arise, either by design or due to experimental circumstances.

\ques{2}{c}{20} Define (i) the reliability function and (ii) the failure rate function of a random variable denoting lifetime of a component. Establish the relation between them, if any. Prove that if $h(t)$ is the failure rate function, then $\int_0^{\infty}h(t)dt = \infty$.

\ques{4}{a}{20} Let there be three components with independently and exponentially distributed lifetimes with mean 1000 hours. Find the mean lifetime of (i)the series system and (ii)the parallel system of these components.
