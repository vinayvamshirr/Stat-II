\ques{1}{e}{10} What is hazard function? Suppose a system has the hazard function given by $h(t) = 3t^2, t \geq 0$. Derive the reliability function for the system. What is the name of the underlying distribution function? Name the parameters of the distribution and specify the values for the above system.

    \item What is a counting process? What are the basic properties of a counting process? Define a renewal process and the renewal function.
    \item If the renewal function is $m(t) =2t, t\geq 0$, find the corresponding renewal process.
    \item Suppose $X_1,X_2, \ldots$ are the inter-arrival times of a renewal process $\{N(t), t\geq0 \}$. Assume that $X_i s $ are independent and identically distributed with $P(X_1=1) = P(X_1 =2) =  \dfrac{1}{2}$. Find the $P(N(t)=k)$ for $k=6,7$ and $t=7.7$. What are the other possible values of $N(7.7)$

\ques{3}{b}{15} Explain left, right and arbitary censoring in life testing. Cite an example of these types. Assuming that the life time follows exponential distribution with failure rate $\lambda$, derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the average life time for the following censored data:\\
$t_1=88,t_2=103,t_3=141,t_4=344,t_5=430,t_6=516,t_7=937,t_8=1057,t_i\geq 1100 \text{ for }i=9,10,\ldots,15$.
