\ques{1}{c}{10} For a single sampling plan, $(N,n,c)=(50,15,1)$, compute the probability of acceptance of lots of 50 articles with 2\% defective.

\ques{3}{a}{15} Samples of size 4 are drawn to construct a control chart for $\bar{X}$. The cental line is at 100 and the LCL and UCL are 96 and 104 respectively. If the measured characteristic is normally distributed with mean of 98 and standard deviation of 4, what is the probability that the control chart will raise an out-of- control alarm at the fourth sample?

\ques{4}{a}{20} In the capability study of a process involving manufacturing items, the specification limits are given as $23.75\pm0.1$. From the manufactured items, six items were selected each day consecutively for eight days. The measurements obtained are given below in the excess of 23.(That is, for example, the first cell value of 0.77 should be read as 23.77).\\

    \item Construct $\bar{\text{X}}$ and R charts
    \item Compute the process capability of the machine.
    \item Will the process meet the specifications?\\(The table values are : $A_2=0.48$, $D_3 = 0$, $D_4=2$, $d_2 = 2.534$)
