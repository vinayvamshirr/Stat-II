\ques{6}{a}{15} Given the following demand-and-supply model:
\[    \begin{alignat}{2}
        &\text{Demand} &&: Q_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1P_t + \alpha_2I_t + u_{1t};\alpha_1 <0, \alpha_2>0 \\
        &\text{Supply} &&: Q_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1P_t + \beta_2P_{t-1} +u_{2t}; \beta_1 >0. \beta_2 >0
    \end{alignat} \] Construct the reduced-form model and justify whether the parameters can be estimated completely.

    \ques{7}{c}{20} Consider a two-variable regression model $Y_t = \beta_1 + \beta_2X_t + u_t$. Suppose $u_t$ is autocorrelated as $u_t = \rho u_{t-1} + \epsilon_t,-1 < \rho < 1$, where $\rho$ is the autocovariance coefficient and $\epsilon_t$ is the stochastic disturbance term satisfying OLS assumptions. Obtain an estimate for $\beta_2$ and its corresponding variance. Also discuss the Durbin-Watson statistic for detecting autocorrelation in the model, and it interpretation.
