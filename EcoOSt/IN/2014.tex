\ques{5}{c}{10} Define Index numbers. Discuss their uses and limitations.

\ques{6}{b}{15} Following are two sets of indices one with 1960 as base and other as 1970 as a base :
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{| l | *{7}{c|} c|}
    \hline
    Years & 1960 & 1961 & 1966 & 1968 & 1970 & 1971 &1972 & 1973 \\ \hline
    Index(Old)  & 100 & 110 & 115 & 125 & 150 & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots\\ \hline 
    Index (New) & \ldots    & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots & 100 & 105 & 120 & 130\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Splice the new series to old series, so as to have a continuous series from 1960. Also splice the old series to new series so as to have a continuous series from 1960.

\ques{8}{a}{15} Explain time reversal and factor reversal tests of index numbers. Examine whether Laspeyre's and Paasche's index numbers satisfy these tests.
