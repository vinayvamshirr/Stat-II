(i)State the uses of different index numbers. What tests should a good index number satisfy? In the usual notations given that \[ \Sigma p_0q_0 = 480, \Sigma p_0q_1 = 340, \Sigma p_1q_0 = 1220 \text{ and } \Sigma p_1q_1 = 852.\]  Find the values of Laspeyres and Paasche index numbers and comment on the results.
(ii) What are chain base index numbers? If $P_{01} = 121\%, P_{12} = 169\%$ then find the value of $P_{02}.$
