\ques{5}{a}{12} For the $AR(1)$ process defined as $X_t = 0.6X_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$, where $t = 1,2,3,\ldots, \enskip X_0 =0$ and $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2,\varepsilon_3,\ldots$ are independent $N(0,\:\sigma^2)$ variables, what is the expression for the spectrum (i.e., spectral density)?

\ques{5}{d}{12} Describe the exponential growth curve. Explain how one checks whether a given time series has exponential growth pattern and how one can fir an exponential trend to a time series.

\ques{6}{b}{30} Derive the normal equations for fitting a linear trend to time series data. Suppoe that a time series $X_t$ has been observed at time points $t= \pm1, \pm3,\pm5,\dotsc,\pm 19,\pm21$ and for this series
\[ \sum_{t} X_t = 528.2 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{t} tX_t = -1956.4.\] Deterimine the linear trend equation that will fit the data.
