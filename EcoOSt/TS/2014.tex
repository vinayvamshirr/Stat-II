\ques{5}{a}{10} Let $\varepsilon_t,\varepsilon_{t+1},\ldots$ and $\xi$ be independent variables with zero mean and unit variance. Considering $U_t = a\xi + \varepsilon_t, -\infty < t < \infty$, show that the process is stationary with correlogram
\[\rho_1  = \rho_2 = \dotsb = \frac{a^2}{1 + a^2}.\]

For an auto regressive scheme $X_{t+1} = aX_t + b + \varepsilon_{t+1}$ show that the correlogram is given by $\gamma_k = a^k$, where k is the order of the serial correlation. Also, show that the correlogram us decreasing exponentially for $ 0 < a < 1$.
